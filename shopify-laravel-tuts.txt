!(Most of these will only make sense if you followed the tutorial on this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB4AdipoHpxbTycAd8VriLJoROLb3hYmh)
!(You can start at episode 21)

***CLONE GUIDE*****
!(This guide is if you don't want to create from scratch and only wants to clone the repo to your local)
!(config.yml is blank, you need to add the details)

*1. Install npm to download node_modules:
$ npm install

*2. Run npm dev to test:
$ npm run dev

!(If for some reason you get errors because of missing depencies e.g. tailwindcss, vue, laravel-mix, etc. You can follow some steps below in installing the depencies)
!(steps: *3, *6, *7)
!(NO NEED TO FOLLOW CONFIGURATION CONTENT PASTING IF YOU JUST CLONED THE REPO. THEY ALREADY EXIST JUST FOLLOW THE STEP NUMBERS MENTIONED.)



***FROM BASE GUIDE*****
!(Follow this if you want to build shopifyxlaravel-mix from scratch)

*1. Install npm first!!:
$ npm install

*2. Initialize npm/package.json:
$ npm init -y

*3. Install Laravel Mix
$ npm install laravel-mix --save-dev

*4. Create new file and name it 'webpack.mix.js' and paste these contents:

const mix = require('laravel-mix');

mix.js('src/javascript/app.js', 'assets') //--> first argument is the source file of your js. Second arguement is the output path after development build (Remove me once copy-pasted)
   .sass('src/style/app.scss', 'assets') //--> first argument is the source file of your scss. Second arguement is the output path after development build (Remove me once copy-pasted)
   .options({
     processCssUrls: false,
     postCss: [ tailwindcss('tailwind.config.js') ],
   })
   .setPublicPath('assets');

*5. update package.json scripts with:
"scripts": {
    "dev": "npm run development",
    "development": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --progress --hide-modules --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js",
    "watch": "npm run development -- --watch",
    "hot": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js --inline --hot --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js",
    "prod": "npm run production",
    "production": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --no-progress --hide-modules --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js"
},

*6. Install tailwindcss and tailwind config:
$ npm install tailwindcss
$ npx tailwindcss init // --> This installs a 'tailwind.config.js'
!(install this first because on step *4 you used a mix needing tailwindcss installed, if you run npm run dev it will cause an error because tailwindcss does not yet exist)

*7. Run npm run dev to test if laravel-mix is working:
$ npm run dev
!(if it works and you followed this step by step it should say that you need to install vue-compiler and will install it automatically).



***EXTRA NOTES*****
~ If somehow you get errors in your terminal do these:
- Delete 'node_modules' folder, 'package.json', 'package-lock.json'
- Run: $ npm cache clear --force
- Run: $ npm install
!(if the error says 'cross-env is not an internal or external command' run this after npm install):
($ npm install cross-env)
- Redo everything from step 1.

~ If vue doesn't get installed, or there are errors with vue during run dev, you can use these commands:
Install Vue:
$ npm install vue-compiler --save-dev
$ npm install --save vue

~ If you did everything here and everything is working fine, but somehow didn't watch the tutorial in the link:
- Run theme watch first and wait for it to finish initializing
- Run npm run watch second to check for changes in your js and css/scss


~If you want to make modules for your tailwind in app.scss:
- import all utilities by using @import:
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
- and not
@tailwind "base";
@tailwind "components";
@tailwind "utilities";
- then import your modules:
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";

@import './modules/_header.scss';
!(Always put a '_' as prefix so sass can read it as a partial)
